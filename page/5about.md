## At school

A student.
I am studying at NITAC Advanced Course Department of Mechanical and Electronic System Engineering.
<br />
I am supposed to get on bachelor degree of electrical and electronic engineering.
<br />
I had been researched **Remote Driving System Usability**,
and **Human Machine Interface of Cars by using RC car**.
<br />
In the future, we plan to develop an autonomous driving system for radio-controlled cars, which will be operated by switching between autonomous and manual driving, and conduct research on problems that arise when taking over driving.

## Hobbys
I've been playing some sports.<br />
ðŸ¥‹ Judo: for 9 years (also have black belt)<br />
âš¾ Baseball: for 6 years<br />
ðŸ¤¾ Handball: for a year<br />
(I like baseball the most.)
<br />
I like reading manga, playing Lego and excercising at gyms.
