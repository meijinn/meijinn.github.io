## For plans

3 years ago, at electronics experiment Class. I assembled a Starter Kit for Electronic work, which are now discontinued. It contained a DC motor, components of PCB and something like them. It reminded me soldering are complicated. 
For now, to connect previous IDEA to real plan, I determine to renew for creating original. Thanks to my teammate help, the plan advanced gradually.

* Scratch for getting 9 V battery space.
* Original ones.
* Adding same motor by electrical-wired.
