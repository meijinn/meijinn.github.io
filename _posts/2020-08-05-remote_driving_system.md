## My prototyping bears fruit

XBee S2C module allows to operate car remotely.

- Initialization at XCTU
- Execute sample code of serial connection
- implementation

## future plan
1. implementating connection lost detection system
2. implementating function web camera video capturing in draw function window
3. VR goggle and 360 vision
