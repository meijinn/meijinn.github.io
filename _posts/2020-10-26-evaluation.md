## Self Evaluation
Enforcing research of remote driving system operation usability on driving test experiment


- Evaluation Landmark -> difference of operational interface, operational view

- Findings -> steering wheel: if it work smoothly, running time is improved.


Best operational equipment: propotional controller, dualshock 3, steering wheel controller

steering controller doesn't win its usability to propotional controller.
