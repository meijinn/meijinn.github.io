## Using Gopro and gopro-api
Gopro can be used on python OpenCV api.
Photo shooting, Video Recording, Streaming and something like that.

1. Easiest way for video streaming. -> failed.
2. Using python api directly -> Part of function is worked but streaming is not function
3. obsstudio and ffmpeg -> appear 10 second latency.
4. Facebook,youtube streaming -> appear 10 second latency.
