## Instruction

This is my lego akira Kaneda's bike created imitate others for obtaining cool lego works build-up feeling. This is not genuine packed product, but my original remake.<br />
It has a litle differ from building genuine packed product. I explored same parts for building it around my storage, and if there are not same parts, thinking about how can I use alternative parts to compensate shortage them designing cooler than former decoration. I like it very much.

## Building guide

I also created Lego building guide on [Studio 2.0](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page). It's like CAD contains many types of lego parts for illustrating. I feel that it is easy to use, confortable.
