## Research Direction
We are attention to clear Usability of
Remote Driving system by using rc car test-running.


And I came up with to study controlability of rc car velocity by using PID and model-based control.
and, aims to develop driving assist function on rc car.

## future plan
- Driving on streaming camera vision (FPV)
- Develop unique driving graphical design
- implementation of acceleration sensor for getting conversion speed.
