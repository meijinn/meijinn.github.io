## Having done

Bluetooth RC car creation has completed until mid-term examination.

## For future

Making steering wheel controller RC car by a term-end examination.
What will I research on steering wheel controller RC car.

### Idea

- Implement driving simulator
- Establish same system by installing Raspbery Pi and comparing it with Arduino at their differ of any performance.
- Modify and pursuit control method.(hand-grove controller)

Thinking takes 2 hours.
