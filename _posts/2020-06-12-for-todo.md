## Having done

- Creating bluetooth controlled remote control car system available to operate both Android apps and PC serial connection port term.

## Estimation that it might be able to done

- Linear-sensed control about something, for instance using joysticks, because formers are touched panel or keyboard when it uses for remote operation.

## Something, made me happy without technical registration

- Arduino controlled from  Processing on wireless communication using serial connection.
- Establish Processing RC operation system to Arduino by using serial connection
- RC car operated by PS3 controller with Processing Serial communication
- Steering controller RC car
- Hand gesture control RC car by acceleration sensor

## Contains separated to two phases

- Able to operate by using steering controller on wired connection from PC to Arduino
- Input character data to serial port, establish communication protocol by myself or how is it useful as interaction.

Thinking takes 1 hour.
