## It still be not work
I can't understand the cause of error, and also can't order code by my skills.

## Make Several Prediction
I think that **Brain Storming** is necessary for me to strive this. So I am catched up with myself.
Then, I tried to clean what we made from scratch.

### Prediction
1. PS3 Controller's Problem
Key config is not compatible in my language.
I attempt to uninstall driver and install it, but Ocation isn't changed. I assumed that it doesn't matter.
2. Only XBox controller is usable
No way, â‡’ Key configuration is worked exactly.
The problem is in code.
3. Saving Configuration File
This is probably the problem. I think I have saved the key configuration settings, but when I run the application, the key configuration assignment screen should appear again, but it doesn't, so I may need to call the key configuration somehow.
