## Assigning a role for members

For Arduino using for experiment class members

1. DC motor control by sound sensor (clapping sounds detect control)
2. DC motor control by ultrasonic sensor (safety brake system for RC car by detecting wall or any object.)
3. Discrete H-Bridge circuits.

They're all under preparing an construction.
Trying Arduino for members anyway is the most necessary things.
