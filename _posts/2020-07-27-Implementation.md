## Circuit components had problem

Throughout two weaks, system function are separated and any individuals do for installment. Sample circuits was worked but addapted motor wasn't working. They didn't work there be element malfunctions.


## Ultrasonic functions was worked!
Ultrasonic functions was worked, and was able to detect easily and smoothly.

## Change policy and goal for completion
At first, Ultrasonic sensor has implied successfully, and other tasks should be done for another function of RC sensitive motion by sound sensor. Secondary, ultrasonic sensor was needed to update for liniear motion. Finally, sound sensor might have specific limits.
