To analyze infrared signal indicated by Hexadecimal, for allocation of rc motion, moving can show the imagine of prototype electronics.

Infrared Remote Controller [pictures]â†“

## Behavior Allocation
- VOL+ --- Forward, digitalWrite(HIGH,HIGH)
- Skip --- Turn Right, digitalWrte(LOW,LOW)
- Rewind --- Turn Left, digitalWrite(HIGH,LOW)
- Default --- Stop, digitalWrite(LOW,LOW)

The system consists of NPN transistor, diode, resister discrete.

Two of fundamental circuit [Please refer previous posts], the main components are NPN transistor, Their BASE are connected on Arduino General-Purpose Input Output pin as digital output.
